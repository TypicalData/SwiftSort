# 📂 SwiftSort
Keeps your files sorted.
# 🏗️ Construction:
<strong>*1. Directory Setup:*</strong>

The script ensures the existence of a 'General' directory.
Subdirectories are created for specific file types: Images, Videos, Audio, Text-Docs, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Compressed, and Others.

<strong>*2. File Movement:*</strong>

The move_files function scans files in the 'Mixed' directory.
Files are moved to appropriate subdirectories based on their file extensions.
Log messages in the Tkinter text widget provide feedback on the process.


<strong>*3. Execution:*</strong>

The Tkinter GUI is initiated, featuring a "Start Sorting" button.
Clicking the button triggers the file sorting process.<br>
Log messages inform users about the files moved and their respective destination folders.

# 🛠️Setup - Terminal Way
1. Make sure you have python installed
```bash
python -V
```
2. Download SwiftSort.py
3. Navigate to the projects directory using ``cd (name of the next folder in path)``
4. In terminal run following command - > 
```bash
python SwiftSort.py
```
# 🛠️Setup - .exe Way
Download SwiftSort.exe and run it.
Windows defender will tell you not to open it, but essencially it's the same thing as SwiftSort.py

If all done correctly you should be able to use this program...
